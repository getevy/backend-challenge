# Work at Evy

At Evy, we strive to transform the product insurance industry for the better. Our mission is simple: create the best product protection plan ever, and help merchants offer it to their customers.

Our product takes several forms. For merchants, we're building an API-first solution that lets them offer product insurance to their customers, as well as a dashboard to monitor key metrics. For customers, we're designing a simple (and fast ⚡️) claims experience.

This repository contains a problem used to evaluate candidate skills for the backend team. It's important to notice that satisfactorily solving the problem is just a part of what will be evaluated. We also consider other programming disciplines like documentation, testing, commit timeline, design and coding best practices.

Hints:

* Carefully read the specification to understand all the problem and artifact requirements before starting, if you don't understand something tell us;
* Check the recommendations and reference material at the end of this specification;
* We appreciate simplicity, so create a good project setup that will help us in your evaluation;
* Please make tests ... we appreciate tests <3... tests make the world better.

## How to participate

1. Make a fork of this repository on Github. If you can't create a public fork of this project, make a private repository (github offers free private repos) and add read permission for the user below:
    * [azrshana on github](https://github.com/azrshana);.
2. Follow the instructions of README.md (this file);
3. Send us an email with the link to the fork on Github;

## Specification

You should implement an application for a library to store book and authors data.

**This application must provide an HTTP REST API to attend the requirements.**

### 1. Receive a CSV with authors and import to database

Given a CSV file with many authors (more than a million), you need to build a command to import the data into the database. The CSV file will have the following format:

```
name
Luciano Ramalho
Osvaldo Santana Neto
David Beazley
Chetan Giridhar
Brian K. Jones
J.K Rowling
```

Each author record in the database must have the following fields:

* id (self-generated)
* name

You need to store the authors' data to complement the book data that will be stored afterward (see item #3).

### 2. Expose authors' data in an endpoint

This endpoint needs to return a paginated list with the authors' data. Optionally the authors can be searched by name.

### 3. CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of books

You need to implement these actions in your API:

* Create a book
* Read book's data
* Update book's data
* Delete book's data

Each book record has the fields:

* id (self-generated)
* name
* edition
* publication_year
* authors (more than one author can write a book)

To retrieve a book (in easy mode) we can filter by 4 fields (or a composition of these four):

* name
* publication_year
* edition
* author

But these 4 filters are optional. It must be possible to navigate all the books' data without any filter.

To create a book you need to send this payload (in json format) below:

```
{
 "name": // Name of the book;
 "edition": // Edition number;
 "publication_year": // Publication year of the book;
 "authors": // List of author ids, same ids of previous imported data
}
```

## Project Requirements:

* Application must be written in Go.
* Go
    * Go >= 1.17
    * [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
* Every text or code must be in English
* Write the project documentation containing:
    * Description;
    * Installing (setup) and testing instructions;
    * If you provide a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) solution for setup, ensure it works without docker too.
    * Brief description of the work environment used to run this project (Computer/operating system, text editor/IDE, libraries, etc).
* Provide API documentation (in English);
* Variables, code and strings must be all in English.

## Recommendations

* Write tests! Please make tests ... we appreciate tests <3... tests make the world better;
* Use programming good practices;
* Use [git best practices](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices), with clear messages (written in English);
* Be aware when modeling the database;
* Be careful with REST API details. They can bite you!

**Have fun!**
